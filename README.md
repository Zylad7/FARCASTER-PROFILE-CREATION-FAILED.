# FARCASTER-PROFILE-CREATION-FAILED.
I am experiencing great challenge creating a profile on the Warpcast application after having successfully subscribed since a period of a month now. I find it very inconveniencing as I have tried contacting and not been able to get hold of the team or anyone linked to the Farcaster Team. It keeps reading failure to creat UID.
